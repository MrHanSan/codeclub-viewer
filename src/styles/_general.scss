// This file should include "normalization type" alterations of tags,

  // Bootstrap uses px for all font sizes, and bases them from $font-size-base,
  // which can be changed in pre-customizations.scss.
  // The global font size for the website is here set to this same value.
  // In general, it is usually smart to base other font sizes off of this by using relative units (em,rem,%),
  // rather than using px directly, since with the latter, a change in $font-size-base won't affect it,
  // and the font's size would not scale relative to all the other fonts.
  // As usual, relative size units are based on the parent (em,%) or html-root (rem), and it should be noted
  // that while the parent usually means the html-root, it might also be one or more ancestors defining their own
  // font-sizes, either based on the html-root, or setting the font-size directly (if it is a bootstrap element).
